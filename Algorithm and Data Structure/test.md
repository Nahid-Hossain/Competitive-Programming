# LOJ 1238 - Power Puff Girls
**Problem Statement:** </p> In this problem, we have a 2D grid denoting the home city of the power puff girls - Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. Each cell of the grid is denotes either
*  '**.**' means an empty place

*  '**a**' denotes the position of Blossom

*  '**b**' denotes the position of Bubbles

*  '**c**' denotes the position of Buttercup

*  '**m**' denotes that there is a monster

*  '**h**' denotes their home

*  '**#**' denotes a wall and the girls can't pass through it <br> <br>
The three power puff girls move simultaneously from their initial position. And in each minute, from their current cells, they can move to any four adjacent cells (North, East, West, South) if the destination cell is neither a wall nor the cell contains a monster. <br>
Now, we have to find the **maximum** shortest distance from the initial position of any power puff girl to home. In other words, if the shortest distance from the initial postiion of each power puff girl to home is
da, db and dc respectively, then, we have to find the max(da, db, dc). </p> <br>
